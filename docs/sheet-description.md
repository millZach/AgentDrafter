# The sheet description

A sheet description is the text file that states what is on a new sheet. It is the sheet's record: the DWG is built from it (ADR-0003). It is written in a strict subset of YAML, set out below, so that an agent can write it, a person can read it, and a mistake is an error that names its field rather than a guess.

So far a sheet description holds lines. Templates, blocks, attributes, layers and notes come in later tickets, and this page grows with them.

## An example

```yaml
# The smallest sheet description: one line, in millimetres.
units: mm
objects:
  - line:
      from: [0, 0, 0]
      to: [100, 50, 0]
```

`agentdrafter build examples/one-line.yaml` writes `examples/one-line.dwg` in the 2018 format and prints what it wrote as JSON.

## What it holds

| Key | Required | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `units` | yes | The sheet's declared unit: `mm`, `cm`, `m`, `in` or `ft`. Every number on the sheet is in this unit unless it carries its own. It becomes the DWG's insertion unit. |
| `objects` | yes | A list of objects, which may be empty. Each object is a mapping with one key, its type. |

The object types:

| Type | Keys | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `line` | `from`, `to`, both required | A straight line between two points. |

A **point** is a list of exactly three lengths, `[x, y, z]`. Every coordinate is 3D; on a flat sheet `z` is `0`.

A **length** is a number, with or without its own unit:

- `100` is 100 of the declared unit.
- `4 in` or `4in` is four inches, converted to the declared unit.
- A number is an optional `-`, digits, an optional `.` followed by digits, and an optional exponent such as `e3` or `E-2`. Nothing else is a number: not `+1`, `.5`, `5.`, `1_000`, `0x10`, `inf` or `nan`.
- A unit is one of `mm`, `cm`, `m`, `in`, `ft`, in lower case, after the number and at most one space.

There is no default unit. A sheet with no `units` is an error, so that no number is ever read in a unit nobody stated.

## The YAML subset

A sheet description is YAML 1.2 with these limits. Each one is checked, and breaking it is an error.

1. **One document.** A leading `---` and a trailing `...` are allowed. A second document is an error.
2. **No anchors or aliases.** `&name` and `*name` are errors. Write each value out.
3. **No tags.** `!!str`, `!!int`, `!name` and the like are errors.
4. **No directives.** A line starting with `%`, such as `%YAML 1.2` or `%TAG`, is an error.
5. **Keys are text, and each appears once.** A list or mapping used as a key is an error. The same key twice in one mapping is an error, even in flow style.
6. **No unknown keys.** A key the sheet description does not define is an error, and the error lists the keys that are allowed there.
7. **Every scalar is text; the sheet description gives it its meaning.** YAML's guessing of types is off: `yes`, `no`, `null`, `~`, `0x10` and `.inf` are not booleans, nulls or numbers. A coordinate is read as a length and nothing else, so `null` there is an error. Quoted and plain scalars mean the same: `'mm'`, `"mm"` and `mm` are one unit.

Comments, block style and flow style (`[0, 0, 0]`, `{from: ..., to: ...}`) are all allowed.

## Errors

`agentdrafter build` prints one line of JSON on standard output. On failure it is:

```json
{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"unknown_key","message":"unknown key `too`; a line takes from, to","field":"objects[0].line.too","line":5,"column":7,"file":"bad.yaml"}}
```

`field` is the path to the value in the sheet description: keys joined with `.`, list items as `[index]` counted from 0. `line` and `column` count from 1. `field`, `line`, `column` and `file` appear when they are known.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `usage` | The command was called wrongly, or the output path is the sheet description itself. |
| `read_failed` | The sheet description could not be read. |
| `yaml_syntax` | The text is not well-formed YAML. |
| `not_in_subset` | An anchor, alias, tag, directive, second document or key that is not text. |
| `duplicate_key` | A key appears twice in one mapping. The message gives the line of the first. |
| `unknown_key` | A key the sheet description does not define, including an unknown object type. |
| `missing_key` | A required key is missing, or the file is empty. |
| `missing_unit` | The sheet declares no unit. |
| `unknown_unit` | A unit that is not one of `mm`, `cm`, `m`, `in`, `ft`. |
| `wrong_type` | A value of the wrong shape, such as a point without three coordinates. |
| `bad_number` | A coordinate that is not a number. |
| `output_exists` | A file is already where the DWG would go, and `--overwrite` was not given. |
| `write_failed` | The DWG could not be written. |
| `dwg_write` | The DWG library could not write the drawing. |
| `dwg_read` | The DWG library could not read a drawing. |

## How it is read

The YAML is read by [saphyr-parser](https://crates.io/crates/saphyr-parser) (MIT or Apache-2.0), a YAML 1.2 parser that reports each node with its anchor, tag and position. AgentDrafter builds its own tree from those events, refusing anything outside the subset as it goes, so a duplicate key or an anchor is caught where it is written rather than lost in a parsed value. The code is `crates/agentdrafter-core/src/description/`.
